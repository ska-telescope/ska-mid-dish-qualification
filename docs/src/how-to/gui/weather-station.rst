After successfully connecting to a OPC UA server, the option ``Connect to weather station...`` is enabled in the ``Connection`` drop-down menu. Clicking on it opens the weather station connection dialog window, where you can select the weather station YAML configuration, and specify the IP address and port of the weather station server.

After clicking on the ``OK`` button, the weather station sensors' values are displayed in the weather tab. All available sensors are polled by default. You can select which sensors to poll or exclude and click the ``Apply`` button to save the changes.
